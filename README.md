## Introduction

  A URL shortener is a simple tool that takes a long URL and turns it into whatever URL [short] you want. For example, I can send you    the shortened URL http://urlshortner/test that will forward you to a very long Google URL with search results on some particular video.

## Features

  Web-based interface.
  Blacklist for input URLs with regex support.
  Url shortening on front end.
  Shortened URLs redirects to the original URL with a HTTP 302 redirect.
  Counter for shortened URLs on hit.
  Clients can specify an expiration time for shortened URLs.
